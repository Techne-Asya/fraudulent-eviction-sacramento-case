## 📌 Case Summary
I am **Asya Weston**, a law student, computer science student, licensed vocational nurse, and mother.  
On **August 7, 2025**, my 18-year-old daughter and I were **locked out of our home at WIP 800 J Lofts in downtown Sacramento**.

We were **not behind on rent**. Two days earlier, I had filed a **Notice of Appeal** and a **motion for stay pending appeal** in Sacramento Superior Court.  
But in a **10-minute hearing**, the judge refused to hear testimony or evidence.  
Attorneys for the landlord **lied to the court** and concealed falsified rent ledgers. The sheriff padlocked our home anyway.  

This repository documents my **federal civil rights lawsuit** under **42 U.S.C. § 1983**, which alleges:  
- Denial of due process rights  
- Fraud on the court  
- Access-to-courts violations (mailbox denial, clerk delays)  
- Violations of California’s **Tenant Protection Act & SB 567**
